DEPRECATION WARNING on line 4, column 11 of input.scss: 
This operation is parsed as:

    0 - $gutter

but you may have intended it to mean:

    0 (-$gutter)

Add a space after - to clarify that it's meant to be a binary operation, or wrap
it in parentheses to make it a unary operation. This will be an error in future
versions of Sass.
