## Large Language Models

Do not submit any code or prose written or modified by large language models or
"artificial intelligence" such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to this project.
These tools produce code that looks plausible, which means that not only is it
likely to contain bugs those bugs are likely to be difficult to notice on
review. In addition, because these models were trained indiscriminately and
non-consensually on open-source code with a variety of licenses, it's not
obvious that we have the moral or legal right to redistribute code they
generate.
